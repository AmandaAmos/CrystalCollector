This is a guessing game based on the listed technologies.  The game begins with a randomly generated number between 19-120. And each crystal is randomly assigned a value between 1-12. The crystal values are hidden from the user, until the user clicks on that crystal.  The user wins when their score is equal to the randomly generated number.  The user loses when their score is greater than the randomly generated number.
